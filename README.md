## PROJECTS
> ### [1.Road Traffic Accident Analysis](https://github.com/abijithabi3416/Projects/tree/main/Road%20Traffic%20Accident)

..*Summary:
  The Road Traffic Accident Analysis project aims to predict road traffic accidents through a data-driven approach utilizing machine learning models. The primary objectives are to understand the contributing factors to traffic accidents and to develop predictive tools 
  for accident prevention.

  *Objectives:

  -Analyze historical traffic accident data to identify key factors.
  -Develop machine learning models to predict accidents.
  -Improve traffic management and safety through predictive insights.

..*Methods Used:

  Data Collection: Assembled a large historical dataset including variables such as weather conditions, road types, traffic volume, and accident records.
  Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared the data for analysis, addressing issues such as missing values and data normalization.
  Model Training: Employed six different machine learning algorithms, including Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Support Vector Machines.
  Model Evaluation: Assessed the performance of each model using accuracy metrics and other evaluation criteria.
  Prediction: Used the trained models to predict accidents based on historical data inputs.

..*Outcome:

  The analysis revealed complex relationships between various factors and the occurrence of accidents. The machine learning models achieved high accuracy in predicting accidents, demonstrating their potential for proactive traffic management and accident prevention. This project highlights the effectiveness of a data-driven approach in enhancing transportation safety and provides a foundation for developing intelligent accident prevention systems.

..* Project Context:

  Completed as part of the Final Data Science Project during my Master’s Degree at Coventry University (2023-2024), under the guidance of faculty and the Module Leader.

> ### [2.Vertical Search Engine](https://github.com/abijithabi3416/Projects/tree/main/Vertical%20Search%20Engine)
Summary:
The Vertical Search Engine project developed a specialized search engine similar to Google Scholar, designed to retrieve publications by members of the Centre for Global Learning (CGL) at Coventry University.

Objectives:

Create a search engine focused on CGL publications.
Provide a user-friendly interface for querying and retrieving publication data.
Ensure accurate and relevant search results specific to CGL members.
Methods Used:

Web Crawling: Developed a crawler to collect data from relevant web pages, including publication details and author profiles.
Data Extraction: Extracted metadata such as authors, publication year, title, and links to publication and author profile pages.
Search Interface: Implemented a user interface where users can input queries/keywords to find relevant publications.
Relevance Sorting: Displayed search results sorted by relevance, mimicking the functionality of Google Scholar but restricted to CGL publications.
Outcome:
The system successfully retrieves and displays publications authored by CGL members, providing a tailored search experience. This specialized search engine enhances accessibility to CGL research outputs and supports academic and research activities within the Centre
